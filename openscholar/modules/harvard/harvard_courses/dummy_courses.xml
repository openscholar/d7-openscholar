The primary focus of the course will be in the development of skills, techniques and both conceptual as well as technical understandings of the application of digital processes and tools to the development of tectonic and construction systems in architecture. We will dedicate the semester to develop a project that takes advantage of a number of emerging and established digital techniques and processes in order to develop new prototypes for construction systems that will take inspiration from and expand on the analysis of a number of exemplary construction/tectonic systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p align="left" style="margin-top: 3pt;margin-bottom: 7pt;"&gt;Existing precedents of construction and tectonic systems will be studied and reconsidered during the course in order to inform and inspire the development of each project. These projects are encouraged to rethink these existing systems in order to produce and incorporate novel expression as well as performance. A period of analysis and documentation of existing systems and their associative geometric and material relationships will initiate the development of both: a rigorous analytical understanding of specific construction and tectonic systems as well as a proficiency in applying this knowledge in constructing associative/parametric digital models that will constitute the tools to generate alternative variations of these systems. This will inform a subsequent phase of prototyping which will utilize the fabrication laboratory?s tools. This prototype fabrication exercise will allow students to gain knowledge in and explore the new potentials and capabilities afforded by the emerging field of digital fabrication in architecture that together with digital design and parametric tools allow for the reconsideration and expansion of the potential applications of exemplary construction and tectonic systems today.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p align="left" style="margin-top: 3pt;margin-bottom: 7pt;"&gt;Students will be guided to follow a process from initial digital analysis right through to physical fabrication of prototypes. The course will cover and develop digital design skills in 3d modeling; parametric tools as well as in digital fabrication. The course will be open to all students and while an intermediate level knowledge of 3d modeling software is encouraged and welcome, it is not strictly necessary to take the course.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p align="left" style="margin-top: 3pt;margin-bottom: 7pt;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p align="left" style="margin-top: 3pt;margin-bottom: 7pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p align="left" style="margin-top: 3pt;margin-bottom: 7pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p align="left" style="margin-top: 3pt;margin-bottom: 7pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><faculty_description>Leire Asensio Villoria</faculty_description><term_description>Spring 2013</term_description><calendar_period>Jan to May 2013 (Spring Term)</calendar_period><department>Architecture</department><meeting_time>Friday 9:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.</meeting_time><credits>4.00</credits><crossreg>Eligible for cross-registration</crossreg><exam_group/><notes/><prereq/><url>http://my.gsd.harvard.edu/course/gsd-06423/2013/spring</url></course><course id="d_ext_2012_2_22621_"><school_name>Harvard Extension School</school_name><title>A History of Blues in America</title><course_number>MUSI E-139 (22621)</course_number><section_number/><location>Music Building PH9</location><description>This course is a study of blues from 1900 to the present. Major artists include McKinley Morganfield (Muddy Waters), Chester Burnett (Howlin' Wolf), Marion Walter Jacobs (Little Walter), Otis Spann, B. B. King, Paul Butterfield, and Kim Wilson. Development of the unique voices of principal instruments (guitar and harmonica) and the role of amplification in establishing the defining style of blues is given special attention. Class time includes listening to and discussing recordings, viewing historic footage, and hearing lecture-demonstrations by major artists. The history of the music is set in the context of social changes that allowed "race" music to enter the mainstream.</description><faculty_description>Charles M.

We will follow in the illustrious footsteps of Rem and our studio will take a series of fieldtrips to the Great Outdoors. We will make base-camp at the legendary Walden Pond 15 miles west of Boston. Walden Pond is significant for its association with Henry David Thoreau, the polymath philosopher, poet and naturalist, who built a small minimal cabin near the shore where he wrote Walden; or, Life in the Woods which appeared in 1854. Also Walter Gropius built his New England inspired modernist residence close by and regularly took his early morning swim in Walden Pond. The Parallel Walden studio will act as a laboratory to develop new ideas and concepts for nature and wilderness in the 21st century. After a forensic autopsy of Walden Pond and environs students are invited to produce a new manifesto for a parallel Walden and transform a 35-acre former landfill adjacent to Walden to act as catalyst for change. The intent of the studio is to re-activate the notion of Walden as cultural manifestation and provide expression of new emerging concepts of hyper ecology. As part of our research we will investigate the wider discourse between art, architecture and nature and study the various solitary cabins of the likes of le Corbusier, Martin Heidegger, Ludwig Wittgenstein and Philip Johnson, the latter who described his glass house as a ?pavilion for viewing nature,? and referred to its lush setting as ?expensive wallpaper.?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p align="left" style="line-height: 115%;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p align="left" style="line-height: 115%;"&gt;Course Schedule:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p align="left"&gt;Thursday / Friday 2:00 - 6:00 pm&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p align="left"&gt;Plus Site Visit September 6 and 7 and Studio September 28 and 29&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p align="left" style="margin-top: 3pt;margin-bottom: 7pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><faculty_description>Eelco Hooftman, Bridget Baines</faculty_description><term_description>Fall 2012</term_description><calendar_period>Sep to Dec 2012 (Fall Term)</calendar_period><department>Landscape Architecture</department><meeting_time>Thursday, Friday 2:00 p.m. - 6:00 p.m.</meeting_time><credits>8.00</credits><crossreg>Not eligible for cross-registration</crossreg><exam_group/><notes/><prereq/><url>http://my.gsd.harvard.edu/course/gsd-01402/2012/fall</url></course><course id="d_gse_2012_0_t210l_"><school_name>Harvard Graduate School of Education</school_name><title>A Practical Approach to Classroom Management</title><course_number>T210L</course_number><section_number/><location/><description>This module is designed to support teachers in developing a practical, effective, and low-stress approach to classroom management.

The term `natural? has in recent decades undergone significant revision, in both biological and philosophical circles, increasingly to include a great many aspects of human cultural process and history. This course will be an approach toward the ideal of a `total ecology?, at once an incorporation of `deep ecology?, behavioral ecology and evolutionary theory as a discipline intended to transform and cultivate an entirely new way of understanding the human physical and cultural relationship to the natural world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;As `sustainability? theories and ethics rise to prominence in the contemporary economic and historical world, conceived largely in terms of remedial and technological intervention, the more foundational questions and forms of knowledge associated with true ecological thinking have paradoxically fallen by the wayside. This course seeks to recover, and in many ways reinvent, the habits of mind in which naturalism once played a central role in human life and culture. This course will focus in considerable detail on early human evolution and the early (Pleistocene) stone age (economics, art, social organization, knowledge systems, etc.), on the `knowledge systems? employed within plant and animal milieus to at once create, exploit and stabilize the relationship to their milieus as well as on the forms that they&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; both create and take on to maximize this stability.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Geological, climactic, biotic, technological, aesthetic and even psychic factors will be studied as contributors to a `total? ecological posture toward the environment. Human `being? will be shown to be a direct and inseparable product of the landscape in which the human type arose and to which it will need once again to return with effective understanding, if it wishes to evade the catastrophes that current science predicts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;p style="margin-top: 3pt;margin-bottom: 7pt;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><faculty_description>Sanford Kwinter</faculty_description><term_description>Fall 2012</term_description><calendar_period>Sep to Dec 2012 (Fall Term)</calendar_period><department>Architecture/Landscape Architecture</department><meeting_time>Tuesday 11:30 a.m. - 2:30 p.m.</meeting_time><credits>4.00</credits><crossreg>Eligible for cross-registration</crossreg><exam_group/><notes/><prereq/><url>http://my.gsd.harvard.edu/course/gsd-03431/2012/fall</url></course><course id="d_ext_2012_1_10236_"><school_name>Harvard Extension School</school_name><title>Abnormal Psychology</title><course_number>PSYC E-1240 (10236)</course_number><section_number/><location>William James Hall 1</location><description>We examine a variety of mental disorders from several different theoretical perspectives.
