<p>This widget lets users sign up for a mailing list at MailChimp.  You will need register an account with MailChimp to set up the mailing list and then enter the API key to your MailChimp account in your site settings.  Once that is set up, configuring the box will let you choose one of your lists.  Finally the box can be configured to display a signup form or as a link that opens a popup.</p>
