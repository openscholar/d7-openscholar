This module allows drupal users to sign up for MailChimp mailing lists.  It does this in two ways.  

Automatic hook
==============

The first is a user hook that automatically signs up new users to the site.  The location and API
key for the mailing list are available in your sites admin page.  You will need to enter an API
key before you can choose a list.  Ignoring these fields will prevent these automatic signups from
happening.

The hook supports a couple magic fields.  

INSTANCES
---------

1. Create a custom field in your mailchimp list.  
2. Set its merge var to "INSTANCES".
3. This variable will store a comma separated list of the server instances in which this user has 
  OS accounts, provided all those OS servers include the same mailchimp API key and list.

SITES
-----

1. Create a custom field in your mailchimp list.
2. Set its merge var to "SITES".
3. This variable will store a comma separated list of vsites owned by that user.  Multiple servers
  can point to the same mailing list and the list will merge instead of being overwritten.

Note that for both these magic merge vars, a user is uniquely identified by an email address 
subscribed to your list.


Signup box
==========

The second is a box that this module provides.  It lets users sign up via a form.  A default box is 
provided.  This box uses the same API key/mailing list that was set in the admin page.  Additional 
boxes can be created to use different keys and lists.  API keys can be set per space, to prevent you
from having to keep re-entering the same key.
