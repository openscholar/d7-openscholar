<p>This widget allows you to embed a twitter feed into your page, pulling in tweets from the twitter user or hashtag you provide. You may use common twitter syntax to pull in your tweets, everything you've posted, or any given tag.</p>
<p>This widget is very tall, so it is best used in a side bar.</p>
